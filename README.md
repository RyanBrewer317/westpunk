A two-dimensional sandbox survival game with fighting mechanics inspired by fighting games, especially Brawlhalla. 
The gather/craft loop will be limited and slow, with a focus on realism. However, there will be ways to mechanically or magically automate parts of the process. 
Characters are drawn as 2D rigged models, making it easy to change skins and add armor and clothing, as well as supporting the fighting-game aspect.
The world generates infinitely in the form of a 2D map of finite-area locations you can visit, helping the world feel more 3D.

The game is written in Go and uses the Ebiten graphics library (https://ebiten.org/) and no game engine.
You can run the game by running the westpunk/bin/westpunk executable.
If this doesn't work on your system, and you have go installed, you go into the westpunk/src/westpunk directory and run `go install`, 
then go to your Go bin and run the westpunk executable created.
Note: this will likely not be in westpunk/bin!
