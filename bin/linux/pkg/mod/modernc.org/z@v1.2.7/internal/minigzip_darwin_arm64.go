// This SDK is designed to work with clang and specific versions of
// gcc >= 4.0 with Apple's patch sets

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support compiler
// feature checking function-like macros.

// The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
// with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
// The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
// in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
// strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.

// __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
// the compiler from warning about it if not used.

// __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
// to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).

// __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
// and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.

// __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
// are hidden by default.
// __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of
//  symbols that should be exported even when symbols are hidden by default.

// __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering
// code using the deprecated functionality.
// __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
// a message along with the deprecation warning.
// This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
// __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
// it will print the deprecation warning.
// __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
// interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.

// __unavailable causes the compiler to error out when encountering
// code using the tagged function

// Delete pseudo-keywords wherever they are not available or needed.

// We use `__restrict' as a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier
// without disturbing older software that is unaware of C99 keywords.

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support the
// nullability feature.

// __disable_tail_calls causes the compiler to not perform tail call
// optimization inside the marked function.

// __not_tail_called causes the compiler to prevent tail call optimization
// on statically bound calls to the function.  It has no effect on indirect
// calls.  Virtual functions, objective-c methods, and functions marked as
// "always_inline" cannot be marked as __not_tail_called.

// __result_use_check warns callers of a function that not using the function
// return value is a bug, i.e. dismissing malloc() return value results in a
// memory leak.

// __swift_unavailable causes the compiler to mark a symbol as specifically
// unavailable in Swift, regardless of any other availability in C.

// __abortlike is the attribute to put on functions like abort() that are
// typically used to mark assertions. These optimize the codegen
// for outlining while still maintaining debugability.

// Declaring inline functions within headers is error-prone due to differences
// across various versions of the C language and extensions.  __header_inline
// can be used to declare inline functions within system headers.  In cases
// where you want to force inlining instead of letting the compiler make
// the decision, you can use __header_always_inline.
//
// Be aware that using inline for functions which compilers may also provide
// builtins can behave differently under various compilers.  If you intend to
// provide an inline version of such a function, you may want to use a macro
// instead.
//
// The check for !__GNUC__ || __clang__ is because gcc doesn't correctly
// support c99 inline in some cases:
// http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55965

// Compiler-dependent macros that bracket portions of code where the
// "-Wunreachable-code" warning should be ignored. Please use sparingly.

// Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
// or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
// that are known to support the features properly.  Functions declared
// with these attributes will cause compilation warnings if there is a
// mismatch between the format string and subsequent function parameter
// types.

// Source compatibility only, ID string not emitted in object file

// __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the
// size of memory that the function allocates and returns. The one-argument
// form labels a single argument that gives the allocation size (where the
// arguments are numbered from 1):
//
// void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
//
// The two-argument form handles the case where the size is calculated as the
// product of two arguments:
//
// void	*calloc(size_t __count, size_t __size) __alloc_size(1,2);

// COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
//
// DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
//		Apple API extensions in scope.
//
//		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
//		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
//
// LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
//		API extensions in scope.
//
//		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
//		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
//		its use is discouraged.
//
//		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
//
// STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
//		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
//		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
//
//		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
//		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
//
//		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
//		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
//		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
//		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
//
// In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
// function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
// tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
// compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
// used without a prototype in scope.

// These settings are particular to each product.
// Platform: MacOSX

// The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
// legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
// while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
//
// __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
// changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
// if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ environment
// only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
// defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
//
// As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
// OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
// will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
// time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
// pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
// compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

// POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
// header file is included.  This permits us to convert values for feature
// testing, as necessary, using only _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
//
// Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
//  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L		1003.1-1990
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309L		1003.1b-1993
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506L		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
//					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112L		1003.1-2001
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809L		1003.1-2008
//
// In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
// Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
// that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L.

// Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec.

// Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
// important.

// Set a single macro which will always be defined and can be used to determine
// the appropriate namespace.  For POSIX, these values will correspond to
// _POSIX_C_SOURCE value.  Currently there are two additional levels corresponding
// to ANSI (_ANSI_SOURCE) and Darwin extensions (_DARWIN_C_SOURCE)

// If the developer has neither requested a strict language mode nor a version
// of POSIX, turn on functionality provided by __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as part
// of __DARWIN_C_FULL.

// long long is not supported in c89 (__STRICT_ANSI__), but g++ -ansi and
// c99 still want long longs.  While not perfect, we allow long longs for
// g++.

//
//  Public darwin-specific feature macros
//

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type is 64-bit, and
// structures modified for 64-bit inodes (like struct stat) will be used.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_ONLY_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type may only
// be 64-bit; there is no support for 32-bit ino_t when this macro is defined
// (and non-zero).  There is no struct stat64 either, as the regular
// struct stat will already be the 64-bit version.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_VERS_1050 indicates that only those APIs updated
// in 10.5 exists; no pre-10.5 variants are available.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates only UNIX conforming API
// are available (the legacy BSD APIs are not available)

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates whether UNIX conformance is on,
// and specifies the conformance level (3 is SUSv3)

// This macro casts away the qualifier from the variable
//
// Note: use at your own risk, removing qualifiers can result in
// catastrophic run-time failures.

// __XNU_PRIVATE_EXTERN is a linkage decoration indicating that a symbol can be
// used from other compilation units, but not other libraries or executables.

// Architecture validation for current SDK

// Similar to OS_ENUM/OS_CLOSED_ENUM/OS_OPTIONS/OS_CLOSED_OPTIONS
//
// This provides more advanced type checking on compilers supporting
// the proper extensions, even in C.

// This is the `system' limits.h, independent of any particular
//  compiler.  GCC provides its own limits.h which can be found in
//  /usr/lib/gcc, although it is not very informative.

// According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
// #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
// same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
// type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
// INT_MIN and LONG_MIN is so the value is not unsigned; 2147483648 is an
// unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).
// These numbers work for pcc as well.  The UINT_MAX and ULONG_MAX values
// are written as hex so that GCC will be quiet about large integer constants.

// 7.18.4 Macros for integer constants

// 7.18.2 Limits of specified-width integer types:
//   These #defines specify the minimum and maximum limits
//   of each of the types declared above.
//
//   They must have "the same type as would an expression that is an
//   object of the corresponding type converted according to the integer
//   promotion".

// 7.18.2.1 Limits of exact-width integer types

//
//       Note:  the literal "most negative int" cannot be written in C --
//       the rules in the standard (section 6.4.4.1 in C99) will give it
//       an unsigned type, so INT32_MIN (and the most negative member of
//       any larger signed type) must be written via a constant expression.
//

// 7.18.2.2 Limits of minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.3 Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.4 Limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers

// 7.18.2.5 Limits of greatest-width integer types

// 7.18.3 "Other"

// WCHAR_MIN should be 0 if wchar_t is an unsigned type and
//    (-WCHAR_MAX-1) if wchar_t is a signed type.  Unfortunately,
//    it turns out that -fshort-wchar changes the signedness of
//    the type.

//     These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
//     and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
//     were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they
//     became deprecated.
//
//     The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
//     The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
//     and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
//     means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
//     and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
//
//     If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
//     applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
//             __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
//     currently not implemented on the iPhone.
//
//     At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
//     recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a
//     better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
//     functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
//     macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
//     as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
//     became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function
//     has never been available.
//
//     For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range
//     it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
//     -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
//     when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
//     but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
//     Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.
//
//     Examples:
//
//         A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
//
//             extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
//
//
//         An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
//
//             @interface MyClass : NSObject
//             -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
//             @end
//
//
//         An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
//
//             #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
//                 enum { myEnum = 1 };
//             #endif
//            Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because
//            __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero.
//
//
//         An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
//
// 			enum {
// 			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
// 			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
// 			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
// 				...
// 		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
// 			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
// 			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
//
//
//     It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
//     source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
//     to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
//     That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
//     OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
//     in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
//     way.
//
//         #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
//             // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
//             // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
//             #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
//                 // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS

//     These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
//     and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
//     were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they
//     became deprecated.
//
//     The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
//     The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
//     and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
//     means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
//     and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
//
//     If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
//     applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
//             __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
//     currently not implemented on the iPhone.
//
//     At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
//     recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a
//     better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
//     functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
//     macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
//     as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then

// MVS linker does not support external names larger than 8 bytes

//
//     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
//   decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
//   This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
//   but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
//   interface.
//
//     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
//   or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
//   case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
//   (providing more output space) before each call.
//
//     The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
//   the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
//   around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.
//
//     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
//   with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
//   with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
//   gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
//
//     This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
//   memory as well.
//
//     The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
//   and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
//   file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
//   directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.
//
//     The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
//   the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
//   even in the case of corrupted input.

//      inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
//    provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
//    inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
//    As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
//    is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
//    being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
//    no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
//    used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
//    complete and before any actual data is decompressed.
//
//      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
//    contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
//    was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
//    contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
//    extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
//    extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
//    If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
//    terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
//    comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
//    terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
//    of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
//    present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
//    absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
//    structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
//    allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
//    elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.
//
//      If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
//    discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
//    CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
//    information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
//    retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.
//
//      inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
//    stream state was inconsistent.

//
//      Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
//    calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
//    before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
//    derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
//    logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
//    supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
//    assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
//    and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
//    deflate streams.
//
//      See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.
//
//      inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
//    the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
//    allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
//    the version of the header file.

//		_lbfsize is -_bf._size, else _lbfsize is 0
//	if _flags&__SRD, _w is 0
//	if _flags&__SWR, _r is 0
//
// This ensures that the getc and putc macros (or inline functions) never
// try to write or read from a file that is in `read' or `write' mode.
// (Moreover, they can, and do, automatically switch from read mode to
// write mode, and back, on "r+" and "w+" files.)
//
// _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
// code as compact as possible.
//
// _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
// than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
// that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
// _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
// _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
//
// NB: see WARNING above before changing the layout of this structure!
