//    Locale-writers should change this as necessary to

//    and not (wchar_t) -1, for each defined multibyte character.

// Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
//    or if we want this type in particular.

// On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_
//    instead of _WCHAR_T_, and _BSD_RUNE_T_ (which, unlike the other
//    symbols in the _FOO_T_ family, stays defined even after its
//    corresponding type is defined).  If we define wchar_t, then we
//    must undef _WCHAR_T_; for BSD/386 1.1 (and perhaps others), if
//    we undef _WCHAR_T_, then we must also define rune_t, since
//    headers like runetype.h assume that if machine/ansi.h is included,
//    and _BSD_WCHAR_T_ is not defined, then rune_t is available.
//    machine/ansi.h says, "Note that _WCHAR_T_ and _RUNE_T_ must be of
//    the same type."
// FreeBSD 5 can't be handled well using "traditional" logic above
//    since it no longer defines _BSD_RUNE_T_ yet still desires to export
//    rune_t in some cases...

// WARNING: reducing MAX_WBITS makes minigzip unable to extract .gz files
// created by gzip. (Files created by minigzip can still be extracted by
// gzip.)

// The memory requirements for deflate are (in bytes):
//             (1 << (windowBits+2)) +  (1 << (memLevel+9))
//  that is: 128K for windowBits=15  +  128K for memLevel = 8  (default values)
//  plus a few kilobytes for small objects. For example, if you want to reduce
//  the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, compile with
//      make CFLAGS="-O -DMAX_WBITS=14 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=7"
//  Of course this will generally degrade compression (there's no free lunch).
//
//    The memory requirements for inflate are (in bytes) 1 << windowBits
//  that is, 32K for windowBits=15 (default value) plus about 7 kilobytes
//  for small objects.

// Type declarations

// The following definitions for FAR are needed only for MSDOS mixed

//
//     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
//   decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
//   This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
//   but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
//   interface.
//
//     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
//   or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
//   case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
//   (providing more output space) before each call.
//
//     The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
//   the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
//   around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.
//
//     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
//   with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
//   with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
//   gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
//
//     This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
//   memory as well.
//
//     The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
//   and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
//   file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
//   directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.
//
//     The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
//   the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
//   even in the case of corrupted input.

//      inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
//    provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
//    inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
//    As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
//    is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
//    being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
//    no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
//    used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
//    complete and before any actual data is decompressed.
//
//      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
//    contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
//    was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
//    contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
//    extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
//    extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
//    If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
//    terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
//    comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
//    terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
//    of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
//    present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
//    absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
//    structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
//    allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
//    elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.
//
//      If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
//    discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
//    CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
//    information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
//    retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.
//
//      inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
//    stream state was inconsistent.

//
// ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,

//
//      Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
//    calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
//    before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
//    derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
//    logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
//    supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
//    assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
//    and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
//    deflate streams.
//
//      See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.
//
//      inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
//    the parameters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not be
//    allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not match
//    the version of the header file.
