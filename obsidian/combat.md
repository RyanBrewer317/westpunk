attacks: up, down, side, neutral, upair, downair, sideair, neutralair, dodge
payload material gives the moves
foundation material modifies move stats
unarmed moves don't have a modifier like that

up: w+j    parry (disarm, grapple, counter, etc)
down: s+j    debalancer (pull, attack legs, etc)
side: a+j, d+j    lunge
neutral: j    bunt (sturdily hold weapon at incoming target)
upair: w+j    upswing (in air)
downair: s+j    ground pound (in air)
sideair: a+j, d+j    side swing (in air)
neutralair: j    recovery (grab out while falling. not like magical lol)
dodge: L    dodge
swap hands: f    swap hands (toss weapon over head and catch it)
balance is an important mechanic in fighting
a balance of 1 falls over to the right
a balance of -1 falls over to the left
balance passively tends towards 0 over time (regaining one's footing)
getting hit with knockback affects balance
so does certain moves, most dramatically the lunge
being on the ground limits movement and defense, and has a long cooldown
so when your opponent is down, you can end the fight right then and there
