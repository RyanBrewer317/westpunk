melodies will be thefted from songs from my childhood
but the actual music will be pretty different from the songs themselves
The chords will be inspired by the melody of course
chord notes will be chosen to minimize movement from chord to chord
the baseline will be basic and non-destracting
chord roots and fifths will inspire baseline
The end of any song should transition smoothly into the beginning of any song

I want to be able to dial-up or dial-down the sadness or intensity of a song mid-song and programmatically
This may mean introducing new tracks, changing bpm/pitch/volume/etc, etc
